# MeetupCodeAssignment

This application determines a user's location and presents a chronological list of local 
technology meetups using Meetup's open_events API

N.B.
Meetup's API requires a key to access local meetup data.

A key can be obtained at this URL: https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/

Once a key has been obtained, you can use it to set the value of the static constant 
MeetupApiClient_apiKey in MeetupAPIClient.swift.
